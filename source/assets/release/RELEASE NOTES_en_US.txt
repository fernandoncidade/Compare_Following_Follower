RELEASE NOTES - Compare - Following and Follower
Version: 2026.2.26.0
Date: February 26, 2026

Version summary
This version marks the consolidation of the Compare - Following and Follower project as an app focused on
GitHub relationship comparison, with a more complete usage flow, useful shortcuts,
and a better organized interface experience.

Main updates
- New File menu with actions:
  - New: clears displayed data and resets local cache/state files.
  - Open: imports .json files compatible with the app format.
  - Save: exports consolidated data to .json.
  - Help: shows the list of available shortcuts.
  - Close: exits the application.

- Refined menu structure:
  - Settings now contains only Language.
  - Options keeps Manual and About.
  - More intuitive organization for daily navigation.

- Keyboard shortcuts implemented/adjusted:
  - Ctrl+N (New)
  - Ctrl+O (Open)
  - Ctrl+S (Save)
  - F1 (Shortcut help)
  - Ctrl+Q (Close)
  - Alt+I (Language)
  - Ctrl+Shift+M (Manual)
  - Ctrl+Shift+A (About)

- Data import and export:
  - JSON structure validation to prevent invalid loads.
  - Support for a single package containing cache + state.
  - Clear success and failure messages during persistence.

- Translations and internationalization:
  - Inclusion of missing translation keys in pt-BR and en-US.
  - Coverage of menu texts, operational messages, and About helper keys.

Usability improvements
- "New/Open/Save" flow is now more predictable and confirmation-oriented.
- Shortcut help dialog expanded with actions that are actually available in the app.
- Error and status messages are more consistent for file actions.

Window behavior adjustments
- Manual and About remain independent to allow focus on the main window.
- Closing the main GUI automatically closes auxiliary windows.

Compatibility and data
- Local files remain compatible with the project format.
- Persistent cache/state structure is preserved.
- No manual migration is required.

Suggested next steps
- Evolve export to include date/time versioned snapshots.
- Add visual comparison between two exported files.
- Expand indicators for historical network growth metrics.

Final note
If this version were a story, it would be the chapter where the app stops being
"a useful tool" and becomes "a social audit companion on GitHub."
Less chaos, more context.
