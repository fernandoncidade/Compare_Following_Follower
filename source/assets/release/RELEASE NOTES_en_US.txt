RELEASE NOTES - Compare - Following and Follower
Version: 2026.2.28.0
Date: February 28, 2026

Version summary
This release focuses on making GitHub access setup easier and giving users more control over local app data, with confirmation-guided flows.

Main updates
- New flow to set the GitHub token directly in the interface.
- Token saving to both user and system environment variables on Windows (when allowed).
- New option to reset token and environment variables from the Settings menu.
- During reset, the app also removes related local data and restarts automatically.
- New "Delete" action in the File menu to remove local database files with confirmation.

- When no local files exist, the app clearly informs the user before any action.

Usability improvements

  - Ctrl+Shift+D (Delete local database)
  - Ctrl+Shift+T (Set GitHub token)
  - Ctrl+Shift+R (Reset token/variables)
- Clearer success, warning, and error messages during setup, reset, and deletion.
- More assisted flow when token is missing: the app can request a token and continue the current process.

Reliability improvements
- The app now makes better use of tokens already saved in the system, even when the current session had not loaded the variable yet.
- In partial-permission scenarios, the app reports what was completed to reduce confusion.

Compatibility and data
- Local data format was preserved.
- No manual migration is required to keep using the app.
