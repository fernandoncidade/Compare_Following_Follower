Version: 2026.3.1.0
Author: Fernando Nillsson Cidade

What is this project?
Compare - Following and Follower is a desktop app to compare, in a practical way, who you follow and who follows you on GitHub. A tool to turn large follower lists into clear decisions, without opening profile by profile.

Detailed description
The app queries relationship data on GitHub, organizes the results, and presents the differences in objective tabs:
- Non-followers (who you follow, but who do not follow you back);
- I do not follow (who follows you, but you do not follow);
- Mutuals (reciprocal follow);
- New non-followers (changes detected between checks).

Key features
- Direct graphical interface focused on quick reading.
- Local cache to reduce unnecessary calls.
- Data source, rate limit, and used request indicators.
- Assisted unfollow action for selected profiles.
- File menu flow with New, Open, Save, and shortcut Help.
- JSON import and export in the app cache/state format.
- Language menu with switch between Portuguese (Brazil) and English (United States).
- Manual and About dialogs with dynamic updates on language change.

Privacy and data
- Data is stored locally in the user profile.
- The app does not send its own telemetry to third parties.
- The GitHub token is used only to authenticate required queries and actions.

Requirements
- Python 3.10+ (source execution) or generated executable.
- Internet connection for updates via GitHub API.
- GitHub token for GraphQL queries without unauthenticated usage limits.

Quick use
1. Enter your GitHub username.
2. Click "Run".
3. Review the tabs with results.
4. Optionally save/export data for future comparison.
