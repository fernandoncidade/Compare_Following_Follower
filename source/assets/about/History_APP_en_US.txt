PROJECT HISTORY - Compare - Following and Follower

Once upon a time, there was a GitHub profile following many great people.
Everything seemed calm until the classic question appeared:
"Who do I follow that does not follow me back?"

CHAPTER 1 - THE FOLLOWER MYSTERY
At first, the investigation was manual:
open profile by profile, compare lists by eye, and hope not to get lost on the way.
Result: coffee running out, patience running out, and no reliable answer.

CHAPTER 2 - THE ERA OF SUFFERING SPREADSHEETS
Then came the "premium workaround" phase:
copy names, paste into spreadsheets, filter, sort, and pray nothing breaks.
It worked... until the volume grew.
Each new check was almost a medieval data ritual.

CHAPTER 3 - Compare - Following and Follower IS BORN
That is when the project took shape:
an app focused on clarity, speed, and practical decisions.
The idea was simple:
- fetch followers and following;
- compare automatically;
- show non-followers, not-followed-back users, and mutuals;
- make actions easier without complicating life.

CHAPTER 4 - FROM "WORKS HERE" TO "WORKS WELL"
Over time, the project evolved into something more solid:
- local cache to avoid unnecessary queries;
- status and rate limit indicators;
- interface with objective tabs;
- Manual and About dialogs;
- support for multiple languages;
- JSON import/export flow.

WHY THIS PROJECT EXISTS
Because time is a finite resource.
Automating GitHub relationship comparisons saves mental energy
and avoids decisions based on guesswork.

OBJECTIVES
- Deliver a reliable view of follow relationships.
- Reduce friction in tracking changes between checks.
- Keep the daily-use experience simple.
- Prioritize local data control and operation transparency.

TARGET AUDIENCE
- Developers who do technical networking on GitHub.
- Content creators who monitor engagement.
- Curious people who like to understand their own data.
- Anyone already tired of "manual audit by suffering."

DESIGN PRINCIPLES
- Clarity over decoration.
- Fast action with low risk.
- Local data whenever possible.
- Direct interface, with explicit feedback.

EXPECTED IMPACT
- Less time spent on repetitive tasks.
- More confidence to decide whom to follow.
- Better visibility into changes between snapshots.

EPILOGUE
At the end of the day, Compare - Following and Follower is a digital detective:
it does not judge anyone, does not create drama, it only organizes the facts.
And, when needed, it still points out exactly where the "plot twist" is in your follow list.
