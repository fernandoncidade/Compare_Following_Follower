PRIVACY POLICY - Compare - Following and Follower
Last updated: March 1, 2026
Version: 2026.3.1.0

SUMMARY
This Policy explains how Compare - Following and Follower handles data. The application is designed for local persistence and, by default, does not automatically send proprietary telemetry.

1. SCOPE AND PRINCIPLES
- User control: data remains under the user's control on the local device.
- Data minimization: only data required for compare features is processed.
- Transparency: users can clear, import, and export JSON data from the interface.

2. DATA PROCESSED
2.1 Data provided by the user
- GitHub username entered in the interface.
- JSON files manually selected for import.

2.2 Data returned by external APIs (when requested by the user)
- Followers and following lists.
- Rate limit metadata and request status.
- Results of unfollow actions explicitly requested by the user.

2.3 Local technical data
- Local cache and state in JSON files.
- Local technical logs for diagnostics.
- Interface settings and language preference.

3. STORAGE LOCATION
Default directory:
%LOCALAPPDATA%\FollowersFollowingGitHub

Main files:
- .github_follow_compare_cache.json
- .github_follow_compare_state.json

4. TOKEN AND CREDENTIALS
- The GitHub token is read from the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.
- The application does not automatically store token values in cache/state files.
- Token protection and rotation are the user's responsibility.

5. NETWORK COMMUNICATION AND SHARING
- The application performs HTTPS requests to GitHub APIs only when the user runs operations.
- There is no automatic data transmission to proprietary analytics providers.
- Other than required GitHub communication for requested features, there is no automatic sharing with third parties.

6. IMPORT AND EXPORT
- Users can open compatible JSON files and export a JSON package containing cache and state.
- Read/write destination is chosen by the user.

7. RETENTION AND DELETION
- Data remains local until manually deleted by the user.
- The "New" action can clear displayed data and reset default local files.

8. SECURITY
- Device and operating-system security directly affects data protection.
- Regular backup of important JSON files and logs is recommended.
- The application uses HTTPS for GitHub API communication.

9. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS
Where applicable, users may exercise rights of access, correction, deletion, and portability through control of local files and by contacting the project owner.

10. CHILDREN
The application is not specifically directed to children and does not intentionally collect data from minors.

11. POLICY CHANGES
This Policy may be updated to reflect feature changes, legal requirements, or technical evolution. Date and version will be updated in the header.
